<h3> 💪🏻 Exercise Instructions Assistant </h3>

Flexify is a mobile app that fetches and displays the details & instructions for different exercises, categorized based on different muscle groups (ex. chest, upper legs)
* Problem - For university co-op students, disparities in gym equipment availability across various gyms and fitness facilities in different cities have made it difficult to find exercise alternatives
* Solution - By centralizing the various types of exercises available, users would be able to find exercise alternatives using the equipment that is available to them
* Built using the [ExerciseDB API](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb) from RapidAPI to obtain exercise data
